    <p>Although, I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, I grew up in Brussels, Belgium.  Living overseas was a fantastic experience.  I really enjoyed meeting people from different countries and experiencing different cultures. I returned to the US for college and attended LSU where I majored in French.  After teaching for a short while, I attended paralegal school which led to a job in the legal department of the Environmental Protection Agency. From there, I moved to a small software company called QWIZ, where I worked as a developer on their French language products.</p> 
    
    <p>After Qwiz, I worked as an instructional designer/technical writer for several years.  Eventually, I returned to the legal field. After several years of working as a paralegal, I have decided to make a career change.</p>
    
    <p>I am currently enrolled in the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at Georgia Tech.  I hope to embark on a new and exciting career in Web Development in the near future.</p>
